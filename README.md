Overview

Welcome to the Eye Health Analysis Project, developed for Barzilai Hospital. The project focuses on analyzing eye health data to enhance patient care and medical education. Initially, the project aims to utilize tabular data and dense neural networks for feature extraction. Future enhancements include incorporating more complex models, such as CNNs, to further improve analysis and outcomes. Additionally, the project integrates eye scan images to build a reliable AI model for predicting surgical outcomes and the preservation period of the results.

About Barzilai Hospital

Barzilai Hospital, founded in 1961, is a renowned medical facility in Ashkelon, Israel. Named after former Minister of Health Israel Barzilai, the hospital is affiliated with the Faculty of Health Sciences of Ben-Gurion University. Known for its high standards in professional and humane care, medical education, and research, Barzilai Hospital is committed to advancing healthcare in the region.

Data Description

The project utilizes both tabular data and eye scan images sourced from Barzilai Hospital's eye health system. The tabular dataset contains various features related to patient demographics, medical history, treatment details, and post-operative outcomes. Additionally, the project incorporates multichannel image data obtained from eye scans. The goal is to effectively integrate these two types of data, leveraging feature extraction techniques, to build a reliable AI model for predicting surgical outcomes.

Methods Used

The project employs dense neural networks for feature extraction and analysis of tabular data. For image data analysis, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) will be utilized to extract patterns and hierarchical features directly from raw pixel data. By effectively integrating tabular data with image data, the project aims to enhance predictive modeling and decision-making in eye care.

Future Enhancements

Complex Model Development: Incorporating more layers and advanced architectures for feature extraction and analysis.
CNN Implementation: Utilizing convolutional neural networks for image data analysis, leveraging patterns and hierarchical features directly from raw pixel data.
Integration of Tabular and Image Data: Developing techniques for the effective integration of tabular data and eye scan images, enabling comprehensive analysis and predictive modeling.
Data Augmentation and Regularization: Implementing techniques to prevent overfitting and enhance model generalization.
