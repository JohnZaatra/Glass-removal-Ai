# Glass Removal by Laser Surgery - Predicting Cataract Surgery Success

This repository contains the final project for my Bachelor's degree in **Information and Software Systems Engineering** at **Ben Gurion University**, Negev, Israel. The project is focused on **predicting the success of laser surgery** through the use of advanced machine learning techniques, combining **tabular patient data** and **eye scan images** to predict post-surgery uncorrected visual acuity.

The model developed as part of this project serves as a **decision support tool for Barzilai Hospital located in Israel and founded in Ashkelon**, providing them with reliable insights into the chances of surgery success, improving decision-making, and ultimately enhancing patient outcomes.

**About Barzilai Hospital**

Barzilai Hospital, founded in 1961, is a renowned medical facility in Ashkelon, Israel. Named after former Minister of Health Israel Barzilai, the hospital is affiliated with the Faculty of Health Sciences of Ben-Gurion University. Known for its high standards in professional and humane care, medical education, and research, Barzilai Hospital is committed to advancing healthcare in the region.

## ðŸš€ **Project Overview**

The project aims to **predict the likelihood of a successful laser surgery** by evaluating the **post-surgery visual acuity** of patients. This is achieved through a combination of **tabular data** (patient and health-related information about the eye) and **eye scan images** (pre-surgery corneal scans).

### **Key Features:**

- **Tabular Data**: The dataset consists of over 130,000 rows and 46 features, including patient demographics, medical history, and pre-surgery eye conditions.
  - After preprocessing, the dataset was reduced to 53,000 rows and 25 input features.

- **Eye Scan Images**: The dataset includes nearly **107,000 eye scan images** of patients before surgery.
  - After image preprocessing and augmentation, the final dataset contains 53,000 images, ready for deep learning.

- **Combined Model**: The project leverages a hybrid model combining the outputs of an **MLP (Multilayer Perceptron)** for tabular data and **CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)** for image data, followed by a regression model that outputs the predicted success rate of the surgery.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Problem Statement**

The primary goal of the project was to **predict the success of laser surgery** by analyzing two important data types:
1. **Tabular data**: Medical records and demographic information.
2. **Eye scan images**: Pre-surgery corneal images of patients.

This was accomplished by integrating both data types into a **combined model**, offering **decision support tools** to doctors to predict the **post-surgery visual clarity** of patients, providing a more **accurate and reliable diagnosis**.

## ðŸ”¬ **Model Description**

### **Tabular Data Approach**:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Removed irrelevant features and handled missing data.
   - Applied feature scaling and normalization to prepare the data for machine learning.
   
2. **Model**: 
   - **MLP (Multilayer Perceptron)** was used to model the relationship between the features and the surgery success prediction.
   - Extensive **hyperparameter tuning** was carried out for optimal performance.

### **Image Data Approach**:
1. **Preprocessing**: 
   - Resized, normalized, and augmented **107,000 eye scan images**.
   - Performed image preprocessing to exclude unnecessary IDs and focus on the main eye features.

2. **Model**:
   - **ResNet18, ResNet50, ResNet152** architectures were tested for CNN-based image classification.
   - Applied advanced techniques such as **image augmentation** to enhance the generalization of the model.
   
3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: 
   - Tuned various hyperparameters to optimize learning rates, batch sizes, and other parameters.

### **Combined Model**:
1. **Integration**:
   - The features from the **MLP** model (tabular data) and **CNN** model (image data) were merged to form a **combined model**.
   
2. **Model Architecture**:
   - The final combined model used **regression analysis** to predict the uncorrected visual acuity post-surgery.
   - The prediction was then fed into a function to generate the final classification output, classifying the likelihood of a successful surgery.
